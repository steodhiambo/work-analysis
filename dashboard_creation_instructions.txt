# STEP 5: DASHBOARD CREATION INSTRUCTION DOCUMENT

## Dashboard Title: Remote Work Productivity & Morale Analysis

## Objective:
Create a one-page interactive dashboard that visualizes the impact of remote work on productivity and employee morale, based on analysis of 2020-2021 survey data.

## Dataset:
Use the 'final_dashboard_data.csv' file containing:
- work_type_standardized (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)
- productivity_score (numerical scale)
- morale_score (1-5 scale)
- year (2020, 2021)

## Dashboard Layout:

### Section 1: Key Performance Indicators (KPI Cards)
Create 6 KPI cards arranged in a 2x3 grid:

1. **Total Responses**
   - Metric: Count of all survey responses
   - Value: 3,019

2. **Average Productivity Score**
   - Metric: Mean of productivity_score
   - Value: 16.30

3. **Average Morale Score**
   - Metric: Mean of morale_score
   - Value: 3.82

4. **Remote Work Productivity**
   - Metric: Mean productivity for Remote workers
   - Value: 21.11

5. **Remote Work Morale**
   - Metric: Mean morale for Remote workers
   - Value: 4.24

6. **Hybrid Work Productivity**
   - Metric: Mean productivity for Hybrid workers
   - Value: 19.18

### Section 2: Productivity Analysis
Create two side-by-side visualizations:

1. **Bar Chart: Productivity by Work Type**
   - X-axis: Work Type (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)
   - Y-axis: Average Productivity Score
   - Colors: Different color for each work type
   - Title: "Average Productivity by Work Arrangement"

2. **Line Chart: Productivity Trends by Year**
   - X-axis: Year (2020, 2021)
   - Y-axis: Average Productivity Score
   - Lines: One for each work type (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)
   - Title: "Productivity Trends: 2020 vs 2021"

### Section 3: Morale Analysis
Create two side-by-side visualizations:

1. **Bar Chart: Morale by Work Type**
   - X-axis: Work Type (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)
   - Y-axis: Average Morale Score
   - Colors: Different color for each work type
   - Title: "Average Morale by Work Arrangement"

2. **Stacked Bar Chart: Work Type Distribution by Year**
   - X-axis: Year (2020, 2021)
   - Y-axis: Count of Responses
   - Stacked segments: In-Office, Hybrid, Remote
   - Title: "Work Arrangement Distribution: 2020 vs 2021"

### Section 4: Correlation Analysis
Create a scatter plot:

1. **Scatter Plot: Morale vs Productivity**
   - X-axis: Morale Score (1-5)
   - Y-axis: Productivity Score (-40 to 50)
   - Color coding: By Work Type (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)
   - Title: "Relationship between Morale and Productivity"
   - Add trend lines for each work type
   - Show correlation coefficient (0.245)

### Section 5: Insights Summary
Add a text box with key findings:

"Key Findings:
1. Remote workers report highest productivity (21.11) and morale (4.24)
2. Hybrid workers show balanced results (19.18 productivity, 3.83 morale)
3. In-office workers report lowest productivity (11.91) and morale (3.58)
4. Positive correlation between morale and productivity (r=0.245)
5. Productivity increased from 2020 to 2021 across all work types"

## Dashboard Design Guidelines:

1. **Color Scheme:**
   - Use professional, accessible colors
   - Consistent color coding for work types:
     * In-Office: Blue (#1f77b4)
     * Hybrid: Orange (#ff7f0e)
     * Remote: Green (#2ca02c)

2. **Typography:**
   - Clear, readable fonts
   - Consistent sizing hierarchy
   - Bold titles, regular body text

3. **Layout:**
   - Clean, uncluttered design
   - Logical flow from KPIs to detailed analysis
   - Responsive to different screen sizes

4. **Interactivity:**
   - Tooltips on hover for data points
   - Filter options by year or work type
   - Clickable elements for drill-down analysis

## Data Validation:
- Verify all 3,019 records are loaded
- Confirm no negative values for morale (should be 1-5 scale)
- Ensure productivity scores range from -40 to 50
- Check that work types are properly categorized (In-Office, Hybrid, Remote)

## Export Options:
- Ensure dashboard can be exported as PDF for sharing
- Include option to export individual charts as images
- Provide data export functionality for further analysis
